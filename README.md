# openmmv

"openmmv" was an effort to extend the open-source OpenSTV Python project with the capability
to work with elections where the voters are allocating funds to projects.  This is 
sometimes called Participatory Budgeting.

We call our approach to STV for allocating funds "Fair-Share Spending".  When we were doing this work
we called it "Movable Money Votes" hence MMV.

Although we are no longer actively working on this Python implementation, the basic structure of how 
the tallying works hasn't changed, so maybe it will remain interesting to someone.
