     The data in these files were gathered by two different investigators.    
Elections 1 through 32 and 48 through 99 were gathered in 1987 and 1988       
respectively, by Nicolaus Tideman, with support from NSF grant SES86-18328.   
Elections 33 through 35 were gathered by I. D. Hill, Clinical Research Centre,
Division of Medical Statistics, Watford Road, Harrow, Middlesex HA1 3UJ,      
England.  Numbers 36 through 47 were not assigned.                            
     The data are records of ballots from elections of British organizations  
in which the voters ranked the candidates.  While the data were gathered under
a stipulation that the organizations involved would remain anonymous, in cases
were the identity of the organization is known, these organizations have been 
divided into four categories: non-profit organizations, (NON-PR) professional 
associations (PR ASN), unions, and corporations (CORP).  There are a number of
instances of several sub-units of a single organization and of several        
elections of the same body being represented in the sample.                   
     The header at the top of each file states the election number, the number
of voters, the type of organization, the number of candidates to be elected,  
the number of candidates running, and the election rule used.  STV means the  
single transferable vote.  AV means the alternative vote (STV used to elect   
just one candidate).  Repeated alternative vote (RAV) is an election procedure
in which multiple candidates are elected by electing one by AV, deleting his  
or her name from all ballots and electing a second by AV, and so on.  MVP is  
multi-vote plurality.  In these elections voters are asked to rank candidates 
because several offices are being filled from the same slate, and a vote for a
candidates who is already elected is transferred to the voter's next choice   
who is not yet elected.                                                       
     Information in parentheses on the header line is information that was not
stated on the ballot.  For some fairly large elections, as indicated in the   
headers, a sample of ballots was coded.  In all other cases all ballots were  
coded.  In some elections, as indicated in the headers, each voter voted by   
listing the names of the candidates in the order of his or her preference on a
ballot.  In all other cases voters voted by placing numbers beside the names  
of candidates on a ballot.                                                    
     For all lines after the header line, the first field is the election     
number, and the second field is an assigned voter number.  In the cases where 
voters voted by listing the names of the candidates in order of preference,   
each subsequent field stands for a rank (first, second, third, etc.), and the 
contents of the field is a letter that designates the candidate to whom that  
voter gave that rank.  For the elections in which voters voted by assigning   
ranks to names listed on the ballot, each field after the first two stands for
a candidate, and the contents of the field is a number indicating the rank    
assigned to that candidate by that voter.  A rank of 99 means that that voter 
did not rank that candidate.  A small number of references to write-in        
candidates were deleted from the data.  Invalid votes (e.g., votes that ranked
more than one candidate first) as well as valid votes were coded.             
     Any questions or comments regarding the data should be addressed to:
